# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in Python. 

## Description

The game is played in the console where a user can choose between rock, paper, or scissors. The computer randomly selects its choice, and the game decides a winner based on the classic rules:
- Rock crushes scissors
- Scissors cuts paper
- Paper covers rock

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. You will be prompted to choose your option: enter `0` for rock, `1` for paper, and `2` for scissors.
3. The game will display your choice and the computer's choice, then declare a winner.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Future Improvements

Plans for future improvements include:
- Adding graphical representation for the choices.
- Implementing a GUI for a more interactive experience.
- Keeping score of the games played.
- Adding more variations to the game, like Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.
